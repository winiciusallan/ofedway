# Ofedway

A set of scripts to set up a fresh installation of Fedora with the Sway spin. This was highly based on [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) and [Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub). The scripts were created to fit my own needs, so if you intend to use them too, I recommend making necessary modifications.

> [!NOTE]
> All configurations rely on my personal dotfiles that you can check [here](https://github.com/winicisallan/dotfiles)

## Using
```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/winiciusallan/ofedway/refs/heads/main/boot.sh | bash
